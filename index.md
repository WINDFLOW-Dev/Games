We design casual games with a broad appeal, which are easy to learn and challenging to master, allowing people to play for a moment, then move on with their day and pick up their game later.

> Our games are also synchronized across platforms, allowing players to switch seamlessly between devices and platforms and continue their game wherever they left off, so they can play anywhere, any time and on any device. For us, this is encapsulated in the idea of bitesize entertainment.
